        <p> <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> is the world's largest landlocked country, and the ninth largest in the world, with an area of 2,724,900 square kilometres. It is a transcontinental country largely located in Asia; the most western parts are located in Europe. Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically, generating 60% of the region's GDP, primarily through its oil/gas industry. It also has vast mineral resources.</p>
       
        <ul id = "board"><strong>Kazakhstan shares borders with </strong>:
            <li>Russia</li>
            <li>China</li>

            <li>Uzbekistan</li>

        <ul id="ethnic"> <strong>Kazakhstan's 131 ethnicities include </strong>:
            <li>Kazakhs (63% of the population)
            <li>Russians</li>

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>The name <em class ="high">"Kazakh"</em> comes from the ancient <em class ="high">Turkic</em> word qaz, "to wander", reflecting the Kazakhs' <em class ="high">nomadic</em> culture.The name <em class ="high">"Cossack"</em> is of the same origin.The <em class ="high">Persian</em> suffix -stan means "land" or "place of", so Kazakhstan can be literally translated as "land of the wanderers".<br>
<br>
Though traditionally referring only to ethnic <em class ="high">Kazakhs</em>, including those living in China, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and other neighbouring countries, the term <em class ="high">"Kazakh"</em> is increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of Kazakhstan, including non-Kazakhs.
